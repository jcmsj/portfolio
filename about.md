Wanting to broaden my knowledge of the tech field, I took on an internship at <a href="https://www.computradetech.com.ph/">Computradetech PH</a>. Here I studied  building secure and robust cloud architectures for providing solutions to business requirements using AWS services and technologies. This ultimately got me an <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/fc854628-e2db-4ce3-afb2-755813b2d404/linked_in"> AWS Solutions Architect Associate certificate </a>.

## Education
::: info Foundation
My early computer science classes were taught using Java, but since I had decided to specialize on Intelligent Systems for my degree, I also became familiar with Python. This required experimenting with expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning using packages like Pandas and Pytorch. 
:::
::: info Web Development
Even before university, I already begun my web development journey independently. I started with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then moved on to using PHP. As early as my 1st year in college, I learned React and Vue. I applied these in my personal projects. Soon after, I started using these whenever possible in my academic projects. I used Nuxt and Vue for my Software Engineering 1 & 2 project. a mix of React, Pytorch, and Laravel for my thesis research project.

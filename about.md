## Experience
::: info Foundation
My early computer science classes were taught using Java, but since I had decided to specialize on Intelligent Systems for my degree, I also became familiar with Python. This required experimenting with expert systems, natural language processing, and machine learning using packages like Pandas and Pytorch.

::: info Web Development
Even before university, I already begun my web development journey independently. I started with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, then moved on to using PHP. As early as my 1st year in college, I learned React and Vue. I applied these in my personal projects like Vue. Soon after, I started using these whenever possible in my academic projects. Specifically, I used Nuxt and Vue for my Software Engineering 1 & 2 project, and now a mix of React, Pytorch, and Laravel for my thesis research project.
